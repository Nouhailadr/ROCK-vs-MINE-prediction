# ROCK-vs-MINE-prediction

This is a program to predict wether an object is a rock or a mine using logistic regression, which is commonly used for prediction and classification problems

So basically, we train a logistic model, predict values and then build a prediction system where we:
- Input the data
- The input data is transformed into an numpy array
- The model predicts the value
- The result (ROCK or MINE) is printed
